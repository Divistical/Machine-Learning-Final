# Machine-Learning-Final

Coding:
1. There is no error message raised when I run your code. 

2. The correctness of your experiments. For example, you should train your model using training dataset and test the performance on the test dataset. 

3. Your conclusion will be checked. Your conclusion should be reasonable and supported by your numerical results.

4. Code repetition must be minimized by efficient use of functions and classes. In your code, you should include at least 3 functions and 1 class. 

Documentations:
1. All your source codes must include thorough inline comments and comprehensive docstrings on functions, classes, and methods.

2. Markdown should be used to add comments, explain your work, make conclusion and etc.

3. The expected ratio of your explanation and code should be at least 2:1.

Submission and Publication:
1. Please restart the kernel and run all before you submit. This can be checked by looking at index in front of each cell.

2. After restart the kernel and run all, please download a pdf version of your Jupyter Notebook (I will show you how to do this in the lecture). Please make sure all of your code, plots, comments, and etc show properly in the pdf file. Then, submit this pdf file to Gradescope. The correct link to Gradescope can be found in this assignment. In Gradescope, the correct place to submit your code is called "Final Project - Code (PDF)".

3. You also need to submit the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file) to the Gradescope.


Requirements:
I expect you to mathematically describe the model(s) (e.g. overall model, objective function, optimization procedure, or algorithm pseudocode, etc.). You can cite any textbook or paper.
Your report should not include any codes or short screen of codes. However, you are encouraged to include figures and tables to explain your project. If you include figures and tables, captions are required. 
There is no page limitation and words limitation on your final report.
(Group submission) You should include a section which describes detailed member's role. 
You should include a section to what you learn from this project.
I expect to see details and reasonings in your final report, not just what you did. For example, I expect to see how did you select hyper parameters, not just saying I use some hyper parameters.
Your report must be in a pdf.file and be written in clear English prose.
